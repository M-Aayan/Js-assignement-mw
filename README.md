## üí∞ Price List

| Product       | Price (PKR) |
|---------------|-------------|
| Laptop        | 20,000      |
| Smartphone    | 15,000      |
| Headphones    | 1,000       |

## üéØ Discount Rules

| Total Bill Amount (PKR) | Discount Applied |
|-------------------------|------------------|
| Above 5000              | 20%              |
| Above 3000              | 15%              |
| Above 1000              | 10%              |
| 1000 or less            | No Discount      |

> üí° **Note:** There is a minor bug in the original code:
>
> ```js
> else if (totalBill = 1000)
> ```
> It should be:
> ```js
> else if (totalBill === 1000)
> ```
> Or simply removed, as no discount applies for exactly 1000.
